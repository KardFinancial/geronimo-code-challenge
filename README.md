# üí°Overview

Imagine you‚Äôre building a rewards system for a loyalty program. To prevent abuse, the system should enforce limits on how frequently a user can redeem rewards. For instance, a user might only be allowed to redeem up to **N** rewards within **T** seconds.

Your task is to implement a component that enforces this redemption limit **per user**.

## **‚ú≥Ô∏è Requirements**

- The limiter should **track reward redemptions per user**.
- Each user should be allowed to redeem up to **limit** rewards within a sliding or fixed **time window** of **T** seconds.
- Any redemption requests that exceed this limit within the current window should be **rejected**.
- Rejected requests should **not affect** the count or timing of future accepted requests.
- The solution should work **in-memory** (no external storage or services).

### **‚úÖ Example Behavior**

If the limit is 3 rewards per 10 seconds:

```shell
User A redeems at t=0s   ‚úÖ allowed  
User A redeems at t=2s   ‚úÖ allowed  
User A redeems at t=5s   ‚úÖ allowed  
User A redeems at t=7s   ‚ùå rejected  
User A redeems at t=11s  ‚úÖ allowed (t=0s has expired)
```

## **üìù Instructions**

Please follow these steps to complete the challenge:

1.	Clone the Repository
```shell
